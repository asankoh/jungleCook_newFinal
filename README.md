# jungleCook_newFinal

jungleCook:

JungleCook is a recipe collection webpage that includes the concept of CRUD allowing the users to do a numerous amount of things in the webpage. The users can go and create a new recipe, view the instructions of the given recipe, edit and update the content of past recipes as well as delete any recipes wanted. There is a login authenization provided if the user wants full accessibility to the webpage. Meaning that users that don't have an account aren't allowed to create or view their recipes. This is a project that was done by Abdul Sankoh and Tom Tran.

Roles:

-Abdul

During the duration of time that was given to us for this project, we decided to split the styling in half. I agreed to style the home page, login page, create recipes page and edit recipes page on top of making those pages responsive. With the responsive, I added the styling and functionality of the hamburger menu so the user can still nagivate the page on a smaller screen. Once the styling and responsiveness of the webpage was done, we directed our attention to the functionality of the page. With the JavaScript, we agreed that I work on the login authenization as well as the functionality of the create and read aspect of the CRUD. I worked on the user feedback for the login authenization, giving the user any necessary error modals if they were to be missing certain content in the input tags. With the JavaScript, I did the inject pages part allowing the user to navigate through each navigation link successfully. I included the jQuery statement in which when the user logs into the page, the yellow button that previously said login know says logout. When logged in, I coded the navigation bar to add an additional link called your recipes.

-Tom

My partner Tom was given the pages of view recipe, recipe and your recipe as well as making those pages responsive. During the process of the project, Tom also did the styling of the navigation bar and footer. Once the styling and responsiveness of the webpage was done, we directed our attention to the functionality of the page. In terms of the functionality of the pages, Tom agreed to work on the update and delete aspect of the CRUD for the project.
